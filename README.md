# variable_image_shape_nn_hiresolution
archieved, non effective, but working

tensorflow.keras fully conv NN feeding with variable input shapes (but still 4D), also an etude for convlstm layers handling.

very, very slow. circa 1 minute per image with rtx2080. after 5 epochs or 5 hours - no/little effects. maybe after 5 millenia? you can try.

this code may contain usefull parts - hence published.
